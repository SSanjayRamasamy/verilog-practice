# AND_gate

## Description
AND gate is one of the basic gates used in digital logic design. It behaves as majority-0 gate as even if one of the input signal is 0 then the output is 0.

In this project, the AND gate is implemented in Verilog HDL using gate level modeling

## Simulation Output

![Simulation](simulation/simulation.png)

In the simulation waveform:

  - The blue signals (a, b) represent the inputs to the AND gate.

  - The green signal (y) represents the output of the AND gate.

  - The yellow signal (i) is the looping variable used inside the testbench to apply different input combinations to the AND gate.
